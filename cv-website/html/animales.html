				<p>Is this Indonesian animal, the world's largest monitor lizard really <em>venomous?</em> Some biologists claim that it's not  
						but that its</br> saliva is so filthy with bacteria that a bite inevitably sends the victim into septic shock and kills them. 		
						Whether the lizard is truly</br> venomous or not, it is an ambush predator that usually doesn't let its prey go off and die 		
						the way a venomous snake does but</br> tears out its throat and lets it bleed out.</br>
			 			Then, the dragon will either tear off and swallow chunks of</br> the prey or swallow it whole if it's small enough. If a group of</br>
						 dragons comes upon a corpse, the biggest male eats first.</br>
						Like a snake, the Komodo dragon projects a breathing tube under its tongue to let it breathe while it eats. Then, it will</br>
						regurgitate a gastric pellet of indigestible material such as horn and hair. Despite its prowess as a hunter, the Komodo dragon</br>
						seems to prefer carrion.</br>
						the lifespan of a Komodo Dragon is between <strong>25-30 years.</strong> 
						Unfortunately, the rumors about it digging up and eating human corpses appear to be true.</br>

				<p>This South and Central American mammal whose very name is a word for one of the seven deadly sins likes nothing better than</br>
					to hang upside down in its favorite tree. It eats, sleeps, mates, gives birth, and even dies hanging upside down in a tree. The</br>
					average sloth lives <strong>20-30 years</strong> in the wild, but has been known to live over<strong> 40 years</strong> in captivity.</br>
					The only thing it doesn't do in its tree is relieving itself. Then, it will climb ever-so-slowly down the tree, drag itself to the spot</br>
					where it always does its business, then very slowly climb back up. Biologists do not know why the sloth leaves its tree to do this</br>
					of all activities, for it makes it subject to predation.</br>
					Moreover, the sloth has a symbiotic relationship with algae, which grows in its fur and turns it green. A microcosm of</br> 
					arthropods, including moths, mites, and beetles also live in the animal's fur. Sloths are also a bit cold-blooded, as their body</br> 
					temperature is dependent on their environment.</br>
					The temperature of a normal, healthy sloth is between <strong>77 to 95 degrees </strong>Fahrenheit. If the body temperature drops to as low as</br> 
					68 degrees, the animal goes into torpor or a deeper torpor than it's already in. Other interesting facts about sloths are:</br>
					</em>Sloths can't walk</em>. The arms of the three-toed sloth are 50 percent longer than its legs.</br>
					The long arms make it an excellent swimmer. The sloth can hold its <em>breath for 40 minutes underwater</em>.</br>
					Unlike most mammals, it doesn't always have seven vertebrae in its neck. It can have more or less depending on the</br> species.</br>

	 	 		<p>The sperm whale is one of the most fascinating marine mammals. Hunted nearly to extinction for the sperm oil in its head, this</br>
					 huge and intelligent animal is still vulnerable to extinction even as it's found in most of the oceans of the world. It's the largest</br>
					  toothed carnivore, has the largest brain, and makes the loudest sound on earth. It has a complex repertoire of vocalizations</br>
					   that help it communicate with other sperm whales and find prey.

 		 		These vocalizations are learned, not innate. Since this whale dives deeper than any other marine mammal, it uses echolocation</br>
				 to hunt in the lightless depths of the ocean. The whale, also called the cachalot, can dive as deep as<strong> 6600 feet </strong>in search of one</br>
				  of its favorite meals, the giant squid.</br>

 				 Not only does the whale produce <em>sperm oil</em>, but it also makes ambergris in its gut. Ambergris is still used in perfume and is</br> 
				 sometimes found washed up on beaches. Indeed, it is vomited up because it's made when the indigestible beaks of squid</br>
				  irritate the whale's digestive system and the whale secretes a lubricant to ease the irritation.</br>

 		 		Sperm whales also sleep vertically with their heads just beneath the surface of the water, and no one knows why. One thing</br>
				 scientists do know about sperm whales is that they typically<strong> live 70 years</strong>.</br>
